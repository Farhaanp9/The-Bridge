                    <p>The unbreakable couple, a happily married pair, works together to create the same craft with an undeniable spirit in the same industry to generate some of the most beautiful work I have ever seen. </p>
                    <p>M Chandra and Muni Laxmi specialize in the Kalamkari style of surface patterngeneration on an already existing fabric. This originated from Andhra Pradesh and is one of the most lengthy and laborious hand painting styles in the world. Kalamkari is more based on the designs drawn, rather than the type of product formed. The art of fabric painting itself involves block printing or hand drawing motifs on fabrics with all-natural vegetable dyes. Although artisans at times utilize block printing instead of hand drawing, they still use a pen to generate free hand motifs to create the finer details of the work. Kalamkari is one of the many art forms that have a very rich history that dates back to the Mughal times (the sixteenth century). It was exquisite then and it still is. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Chandra and his wife Ms. Muni come from a town in Andhra Pradesh known as Srikalahasti, which in the sixteenth century was a hub for Kalamkari artists. They have been practicing this art for the past 25 years, with each of their pieces taking around 1 month to complete. In a discussion with the two, they stated that this form is extremely special and is worth every rupee. The designs generated on the fabric surface itself are special, they usually represent characters and story depiction from Hindu mythology as the central image of the cloth. Various Gods, Goddesses, the peacock, flora and fauna from the heartlands of India, the bow and arrow etc. are some of the motifs that are frequently seen on the fabric. The entire process is painstaking along with its various sub-processes that take place to create the final product. The biggest benefit of it all is the fact that it is all natural. This is not only useful for those with sensitive skin but also it is comfortable, and it protects the environment.  The entire process may appear like a seamless procedure, well there are cases where it is not. Water is an essential element to the art, there are around 20 sub-processes which are washing the fabric to getting it to the perfect consistency for the designs to be made. A scarcity of water can push back the production by a leap.</p>
                    <p>This is their primary source of income, they sell their product from home or they visit exhibitions. This couple loves all aspects of what they do. Their work is the best of the best, learning from a famous artist like Guru Muni Reddy proves their legitimacy.</p>
