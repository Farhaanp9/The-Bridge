                    <p>The father-son duo from Rajasthan bring their traditional craft here to Telangana, Hyderabad. Naimul Ahmed and Mubarak Hussain specialize in handloom Kota Doria weaving. This process is widely famous in the region of Kota, Rajasthan and they have brought that intricate style here to the south—a clear example of the diffusion of cultures we see today across the globe. The Kota Doria, also known as the Kota Dori is a distinctive weaving style with a unique square checked pattern that is crafted on cotton, extremely fine silk or a blend of each of these fibers to create the light and sheer Kota fabric. The silk provides a lustrous feel and makes the product soft to the touch whereas the cotton provides the strength to the fabric. Due to this style being so connected to the traditions and customs of the people of Kota, it has been deemed a geographical indication for Rajasthan. Mr. Naimul has been practicing this weaving craft for the past 40 years and is now on a five-year long journey training his son, Mr. Mubarak, to become a master weaver like him. </p>
                  <p>In a discussion with Mr. Mubarak he explains how the weave can be so beneficial to people because the product is light weight and can be infused with gold or silver wires to make it an exquisite piece. The product is handmade as well, there is that sweat and effort put in which is seen in the details of the work. Since the product is handmade, the entire weaving process can take up to 2 months to create a single piece. If you are thinking this was just a long, safe process, well you are wrong. Mubarak said that your hands and legs are used maximum 30,000 times which can lead to strains, muscle pulls or even ligament tears, but these two always pull through for the love of the tradition and to bring basic food to the table for their joint family.</p>
                  <p>Although they put in such a huge amount of heart and soul into their work while working in deplorable conditions, they still are not receiving what they deserve. The only source of revenue they have are through exhibitions and one on one interaction with clients which at times may not go as well as they would have hoped. However, no matter what happens he stated that he will never back down because not only is it something passed down from generation to generation in his family, but he has a passion for what he does.</p>
